# TSPushFileSource

The Directshow filter is intended for reading .ts files received from the network in the form of MPEG TS transport packets. The search for synchro bytes is registered inside the filter, as well as functions for obtaining the number of bytes read as a percentage, as well as for setting the pointer to bytes in the file to a certain value.
